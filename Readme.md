3D Objects
==========

Tool for previewing 3D objects in the DarkBASIC Engine.

Some notes:
-----------

To help with sprites and images I implemented a sprite and image pool, so I don't have to worry about keeping track of the image and sprite numbers.

I'm currently working the File Dialog for the program.

This program needs to have the ability to load a file, view the file, run the frames of animation if DarkBASIC can do that, apply the texture if there is one, and close the file, and exit.
